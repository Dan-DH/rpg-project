## Exercise

This exercise is part of [BeCode's](https://becode.org/) Junior Web Developer bootcamp curriculum.

The website must contain a game with RPG-like turn-based combat for two players. The logic of the game must be done in JavaScript, using objetcs for the characters' classes.

[Exercise specifications](https://github.com/becodeorg/BXL-Swartz-5.34/blob/main/1.The-Field/12.Javascript/rpg-project)

**Site functionalities:**

- Possibility to choose from four different classes and weapons, each with their own set of stats.
- Abilitiy to name the characters, or use the default Player 1 and Player 2.
- Three actions to choose from each turn:
  - Attack: Deals a fixed amount of damage, depending on character, with a chance to crit for x1.5 damage. Normal attacks can be dodged or deflected, inflicting half the damage back to the attacker. Critical hits can only be dodged.
  - Heal: Restores a random amount of health between 1 and 10.
  - Surrender: Inmediately ends the game, granting victory to the oponent.
- Four character animations: attack, dodge, received damage, and death/surrender.
- Game log describing the actions taken each turn.
- Health bar, animated on real time.
- On game over, pop-up displaying the character and name of the winner, and the possibility to either start a rematch or close the popup to read the match log.
